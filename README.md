# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
A sassy movie recommendation engine written in Java

This is a command-line-based movie recommendation engine which I developed for my Data Modeling course durring my last semester as an undergraduate. The requirement specifications were flexible as long as the program gave sensible recommendations at the final demo, so, to make interacting with the program more interesting, I gave the engine a little attitude. 

The project effectively had 4 parts: 
  1. Design a normalized database based on 2 related raw datasets (ERD)
  2. Preprocess (huge) raw dataset into useful format (CSV files)
  3. Write a Java program that connects to a local MySQL server and builds the database from the normalized data (MovieDBuilder.java)
  4. Extend the program to take user input, query the database, calculate similarity matricies, and present the user with movie recommendations... with attitude.
